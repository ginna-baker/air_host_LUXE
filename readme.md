Luxe is a CMS platform that lets any AirBNB host become the local tour guide/luxury concierge for their guests by creating a beautiful custom website for their property.  This website allows the host to provide activity suggestions, restaurant picks, and tips to guests for enjoying the area.

Features:

This project includes two integrated but separate sites: one to attract hosts and help them manage their listings, and another for guests to view their host’s website.

The mongoose schema was carefully crafted to anticipate the host’s and guest’s needs, including information for international travelers.  As part of the effort to make the site easy to set up, we scrape the AirBNB listing to get all the user’s pictures and critical info and automatically add it to their listing’s database schema.

In order to make the process easy for hosts, the custom site is already mostly functional before the host even touches it, so that all it needs is a few pieces of information.  The UI uses hover events, carousel click events, and tooltips as part of an effort to pre-load the site with beautiful pictures and minimize distracting (but useful) text.

Challenges and future build-out:

Every CMS faces one huge challenge: the uncertainty of user input.  This site was built to allow for any case, including the possibility that a user would leave an input or an entire section blank.  On the other end of the spectrum, one next step would be the addition of character limits to protect the integrity of the layout.

This is one case where web technology has the potential to truly make a world of difference for tens of thousands of AirBNB hosts, many of whom support themselves partially through AirBNB hosting, as well as for the many guests who are interested in a luxury experience with less cost and more flexibility.

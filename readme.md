Luxe is a CMS platform that lets any AirBNB host become the local tour guide/luxury concierge for their guests by creating a beautiful custom website for their property.  This website allows the host to provide activity suggestions, restaurant picks, and tips to guests for enjoying the area.

Features:

This project includes two integrated but separate sites: one to attract hosts and help them manage their listings, and another for guests to view their host’s website.

The mongoose schema was carefully crafted to anticipate the host’s and guest’s needs, including information for international travelers.  As part of the effort to make the site easy to set up, we scrape the AirBNB listing to get all the user’s pictures and critical info and automatically add it to their listing’s database schema.

In order to make the process easy for hosts, the custom site is already mostly functional before the host even touches it, so that all it needs is a few pieces of information.

The host's finished product site uses hover events, carousel click events, and tooltips as part of an effort to pre-load the site with beautiful pictures and minimize distracting (but useful) text.

Challenges and future build-out:

Every CMS faces one huge challenge: the uncertainty of user input.  This site was built to allow for any case, including the possibility that a user would leave an input or an entire section blank.  On the other end of the spectrum, one next step will be the addition of character limits to protect the integrity of the layout.

Next, the project will undergo testing to ensure that it can effectively manage user data (both scraped and entered) even with the presence of a variety of challenging edge cases.
